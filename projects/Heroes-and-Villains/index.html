  <h3>A website to learn the pacing of content.</h3>
  <p>Heroes and Villains was a project that was slightly different to anything I’ve did on the web before.
My vision for it had a very graphic heavy approach. I had to learn how to create overlays in CSS in a way that doesn’t hurt the rest of the design.</p>

<p>I started off this project by exploring styles I could design it in. I very quickly came attached to the old newspaper look after creating a mood board
and style tile for it. (As well as finding the font “Amador” on Typekit - perfect for a newspaper headline!)</p>

<p>Because this was an exercise in pacing content I designed a newspaper layout in Illustrator, before I started in any code. It was just a very basic
text layout design. When doing this looking at my mood board, which is filled with old newspapers, really helped in figuring out the layout. This
process also helped me lay the groundwork for how I wanted elements such as block quotes to look.</p>

<div class="img-center">

<img src="/resources/images/case-studies/heroes-process.png" />

</div>

<p>Normally, I’d have started on paper for this type of thing, but I felt that the typefaces play too strong a part in a design like this to ignore. For the layout
I had such strong reference material from my mood board that wireframes wouldn’t have helped me much.</p>

<p>When it came to consider how I was going to split up the “story” of the page, I considered at first using TurnJS to have fully interactive pages that could be turned. I
couldn’t get this to work well enough to meet my standards however. I then considered just having multiple newspaper pages as you scroll down the page, and this is what
I went with. It worked well in my opinion, especially with a nice slide in animation as you scroll down.</p>

<p>On a more micro scale of how to pace the story I thought the layout itself being in columns would help with this, but I also added in the silhouettes to break up the paragraphs,
as a pause. Large headers helped do this as well. Overall newspapers are fantastically designed to split content up so it felt very natural.</p>
